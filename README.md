# E2E Automation To-Do MVC ✅

This project consists of **end-to-end (E2E)** test automation for the **To-Do MVC** application using **Cypress**. The goal is to ensure the application's quality by validating features such as creating, marking, and removing tasks, as well as checking if the interface behaves as expected in different scenarios.

The tests include checks for UI elements like task lists, interaction buttons, and filter behavior, in addition to performing full flows to ensure the application functions correctly from start to finish.
